FarmVille - FVille

## Design Patterns:
### Command Pattern:
 - Move Main Character by Keyboard
 - Change movement key

### State Design Pattern:
 - Animation Transition of Main Character
 - Farm: Different states of Farm Plot (seed, water, ripe, harvest)
 
### Object Pool Pattern:
 - Rain drop creation

## Algorithms:
### Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm:
 - Move Main Character by Mouse click
 - Algorithmic Complexity: O(v^2)
 
## Data Structures:
### Undirected Weighted Graph:
 - Used in Shortest Path Algorithm
 
### Sorted Linked List:
 - Used in Shortest Path Algorithm
 
### Queue:
 - List of Seeds that user buys and uses
 
## File I/O:
 - Store user data to File: Money

## Other:
 - Map: Tilemap
